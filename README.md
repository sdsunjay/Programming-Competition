Programming-Competition
=======================

This repo holds all the small programs I have written during timed programming competitions.
All code in this repository is written soley by myself. No one else contributed at any point in time to the creation of this code.
All code in this repository was written during one or more programming competitions, which means it was written under extreme time pressure.
Code was being written to complete a task as fast as possible, which accounts for the lack of comments and style.
